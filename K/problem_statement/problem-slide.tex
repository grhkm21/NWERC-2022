    \begin{itemize}
        \item Each of $2 \leq n\leq 10^5$ people would like a pizza slice with
            exactly $2$ out of $2\leq k\leq 10^5$ ingredients.
        \item Determine whether it is possible to prepare the pizza
        such that every chosen ingredient is used on a single consecutive range of pizza slices
        while satisfying all the chosen topping combinations.
    \end{itemize}
