    \begin{itemize}
        \item Determine a consistent final guess of length $\ell$ in a \emph{Wordle} game
        where you have already guessed $g - 1$ times ($2 \leq g \leq 500$, $1 \leq \ell \leq 500$).
        \item For every guess, the letters are marked in either green, yellow, or black.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Green indicates that the letter is in the hidden word and appears in the same position.
            \item Yellow indicates that the letter is in the hidden word, but in a different position.
            \item Black indicates that the letter has no more occurrences in the hidden word.
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
