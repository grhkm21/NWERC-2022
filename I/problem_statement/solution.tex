  \begin{block}{Problem}
    A group of players takes turns counting through the integers from $c$ to $d$, except that
    \vspace{-0.5em}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item each multiple of $a$ is replaced by \texttt{Fizz}
      \item each multiple of $b$ is replaced by \texttt{Buzz}
      \item each multiple of both $a$ and $b$ is replaced by \texttt{FizzBuzz}
    \end{itemize}
    \vspace{-0.5em}
    Given a transcript of the game, reverse engineer the parameters $a$ and $b$.
  \end{block}
  \pause
  \begin{block}{Solution}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item<+-> Find all the positions with \texttt{Fizz} (or
        \texttt{FizzBuzz}) and all the positions with \texttt{Buzz} (or
        \texttt{FizzBuzz}), then solve independently.
      \item<+-> Three cases depending on the number of occurrences:
        \begin{tabular}{c c l}
          $2$ or more & $\leadsto$ & output the difference between the first two occurrences. \\
          $1$ & $\leadsto$ & output the position of that single occurrence. \\
          $0$ & $\leadsto$ & output some number past the end of the range. \\
        \end{tabular}
