                \item Solve the reverse of \emph{Fizz Buzz}:
                given a transcript of part of the game (not necessarily starting at $1$),
                find possible values of $a$ and $b$ ($1 \leq a,b \leq 10^6$) that could have been used to generate it.
                \item In the transcript, every $a$th number is replaced with ``\texttt{Fizz}''
                and every $b$th number is replaced with ``\texttt{Buzz}''
                (or ``\texttt{FizzBuzz}'' if the number is divisible by both $a$ and $b$).
                \item The transcript starts at $c$ and ends at $d$ ($1 \leq c \leq d \leq 10^5$).
            \end{itemize}
