# NWERC 2022

Repository for Team W's solutions to NWERC 2022, hosted in Delft, Netherlands. We solved 7 / 12 and placed 35th.

I tried my best to recreate our solutions we had in NWERC. However, there are some missing, and some are changed.

- A: unsolved
- B: solved (py)
- C: solved (py)
- D: solved, not included
- E: solved (py)
- F: unsolved
- G: solved (cpp)
- H: solved, not included
- I: solved (py)
- J: solved (cpp)
- K: solved (py)
- L: unsolved

In particular, the codes for E and K are interesting. I have also included my `check.sh` files as the output_validators are hard to use.
