    \begin{itemize}
        \item Construct a graph such that the average optimal time to reach vertex $1$ is exactly $\displaystyle\frac{a}{b}$ ($1 \leq a,b \leq 1000$)
        or determine that this is impossible.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Use up to $10^6$ vertices and edges.
            \item Self loops and parallel edges are allowed.
        \end{itemize}
        \item You are given that if there exists a valid graph, then there also
            exists one within these bounds.
    \end{itemize}
